		Configure Storage by Using EBS [Guided]

AWS EC2
- Create an EBS volume
- Modified the EBS volume type and size
- Attached the volume to an EBS instance

1.Create an EBS volume

Create an 8 GiB General Purpose SSD (gp2) Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, and then configure a tag by using a key of Name and a value of Volume-32807137.
In the AWS Management Console, select Services, in AWS Services, expand All services, and then select EC2.
In the Navigation pane, in Elastic Block Store, select Volumes.
Select Create Volume.
In Volume Type, ensure that General Purpose SSD (gp2) is selected.
In Size, enter 8 GiB.
Select Add Tag.
In Key, enter Name, and then in Value, enter Volume-32807137.
Review the remaining default values, and then select Create Volume.
EBS volumes can use either the solid state drive (SSD) or hard disk drive (HDD) volume type. SSD has a higher cost and is ideal for applications that require better performance. HDD has a lower cost and is ideal for long-term storage.

You may need to refresh the page to verify that the volume has been created successfully.

2.Modify an EBS volume

Change the volume type to Throughput Optimized HDD and the size to 500 GiB.
Select the Volume-32807137 volume, select Actions, and then select Modify Volume.
In Volume Type, select Throughput Optimized HDD (st1).
In Size, enter 500 GiB, and then select Modify.
In the Modify Volume dialog box, select Modify.

3.Attach the EBS volume to an EC2 instance

Attach the new volume to the running WebServer EC2 instance.
Select the new volume, select Actions, and then select Attach Volume.
Select Search instance ID or Name tag, and then select the running WebServer instance.
Select Attach Volume.
EC2 workloads are backed by EBS. You can use an EBS volume as the base drive for a EC2 workload or as an additional data drive.
After you attach the volume to a running instance, the state changes to in-use. You may need to refresh the page to see the change in state.
