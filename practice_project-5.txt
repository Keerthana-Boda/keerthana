								Singly Linked List
DESCRIPTION

This section will guide you to: 
● Write a program in Java to delete the first occurrence of a key in a singly linked list 
● Use Eclipse (the popular text editor for Java programs) 
● Push code to Git


package arrays;
import java.util.*;

public class DeleteKey {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<String>();
        list.addLast("apple");
        list.addLast("banana");
        list.addLast("cat");
        
 
        System.out.print("List before removing the first Occurrence of one" );
        System.out.println(list);
        list.removeFirstOccurrence("apple");
 
        System.out.print("List after removing the first Occurrence of one");
        System.out.println(list);

	}

}


OUTPUT:

List before removing the first Occurrence of one[apple, banana, cat]
List after removing the first Occurrence of one[banana, cat]
