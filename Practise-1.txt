						Programming the Threads Creation
DESCRIPTION
This section will guide you to:
Write a program in Java to create a thread by extending the ‘Thread’ class and by implementing the “Runnable” interface

//By extending 'Thread' class 

package createthread;

public class ThreadByExtends extends Thread {
	
	public void run() 
	{
		System.out.println("Thread by extending Thread class");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		ThreadByExtends x = new ThreadByExtends();
		x.run();
		
		

	}

}

OUTPUT:

Thread by extending Thread class


//By implementing 'Runnable' interface

package createthread;
public class MyThread implements Runnable
{
	
	public void run() 
	{
		System.out.println("Thread by implementing Runnable interface");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		
		MyThread t = new MyThread();
		t.run();

	}

}


OUTPUT:

Thread by implementing Runnable interface
