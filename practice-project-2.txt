							Binary Search 
DESCRIPTION
This section will guide you to: 

● Create a Java class in your IDE
● Implement the binary search algorithm in a predefined array
● Check if the element is available in the predefined array


package searching;

public class BinarySearch 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int arr[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 77 };
		int key = 30;
		int indexOfKey = binarySearch(arr, 0, arr.length, key);
		if (indexOfKey != -1)
			System.out.println(key + " was found in index position " + indexOfKey);
		else
			System.out.println(key + " was not found");
	}
	
	private static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int start, int end, int key) 
	{
		int midValue = (start + end) / 2;
		while (start <= end) 
		{
			if (key > arr[midValue]) 
			{
				start = midValue + 1;				
			}
			else
			if (arr[midValue] == key)
				return midValue;
			else  
			{
				end = midValue - 1;
			}	
			midValue = (start + end) / 2;
		}
		// if we are here that means the key was not found.
		return -1;
	}
}


OUTPUT:

30 was found in index position 2
