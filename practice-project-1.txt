						Linear Search
DESCRIPTION
This section will guide you to: 

● Create a Java class in your IDE
● Implement the linear search algorithm in a predefined array 
● Check if the element is available in the predefined array

 
package searching;

public class LinearSearch 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int arr[] =  {10,20,30,23, 40,50, 77};
		
		int key=10;
		
		int indexOfKey = linearSearch(arr, key);
		
		if(indexOfKey != -1)
			System.out.println(key + " was found in index position "+ indexOfKey);
		else
			System.out.println(key + " was not found");
	}

	private static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int key) 
	{
		
		for (int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) 
		{
			
			if(arr[i] == key) 
				return i;
		}
		
		return -1;

	}

}


OUTPUT:

10 was found in index position 0
