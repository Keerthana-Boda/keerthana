				Directives..
DESCRIPTION
This section will guide you to:
● Implement Angular directives


Step 3.7.1: Creating a directive
●	Change the color of the tag.
●	Open Visual Studio Code
●	Add the color property with the help of ElementRef.

// Required services for custom directives
import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appChangeColor]' // Directive selector
})

export class ChangeColorDirective {

  constructor(elem: ElementRef, renderer: Renderer2) {
    renderer.setStyle(elem.nativeElement, 'color', 'olive');
  }

}

Step 3.7.2: Declaring the directive

●	Declare the directive in declaration array.

import { ChangeColorDirective } from './ChangeColor.directive';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        SharedModule,
        AppRoutingModule
    ],
    declarations: [
        ChangeColorDirective,
        ProductComponent,
        MyUpperPipe,
        DiscountPipe,
        ProductSearch,
        ProductDetailComponent
    ],




Step 3.7.3: Adding the directive as a property

●	Add the created directive as a property.

 <h4 appChangeColor>Number of Product Serach on Basis of {{userInput}}:</h4>


 
Step 3.7.4: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
